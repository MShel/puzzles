Binary tree is useful for fast searching and ordering the data.

The unbalanced binary tree is pretty much a linked list so its bad
for searching.

LinkedList - degenerated binary tree(all nodes have only one child, that will happen if you push sorted data to simple binary tree)

Balanced one though is really good:
Memory usage O(n) 
Search		O(log n)[1]	O(log n)[1]
Insert		O(log n)[1]	O(log n)[1]
Delete		O(log n)[1]	O(log n)[1]
